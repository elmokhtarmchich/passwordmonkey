      <h1>SIM-Swapper, Scattered Spider Hacker Gets 10 Years</h1>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> Aug 21, 2025 | <strong>Author:</strong> Password Monkey</p>
      <p>A 21-year-old Florida man at the center of a prolific cybercrime group known as "Scattered Spider" was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison today, and ordered to pay roughly $13 million in restitution to victims.

Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. pleaded guilty in April 2025 to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy. Florida prosecutors alleged Urban conspired with others to steal at least $800,000 from five victims via SIM-swapping attacks that diverted their mobile phone calls and text messages to devices controlled by Urban and his co-conspirators.</p>
