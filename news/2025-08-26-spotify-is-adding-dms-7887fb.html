<p class="has-text-align-none">Spotify is introducing a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-08-26/introducing-messages-a-new-way-to-share-what-you-love-on-spotify-with-friends-and-family/">direct messaging feature</a> that allows users to share music, podcast, and audiobook recommendations with each other without leaving the app. Messages is rolling out in “select markets” this week, according to Spotify’s press release, and will be available on mobile devices for Free and Premium users aged 16 years and older.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The messaging feature can be accessed by tapping the share icon when listening to a song, podcast, or audiobook in the Now Playing view, and selecting a friend to send it to. Spotify users can share content and start messages with people they share a Spotify plan with, or other users they’ve interacted with through Spotify before, such as via Jams, Blends, and Collaborative Playlists.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The feature aims to consolidate content recommendations that already happen over texts, social media, and third-party messaging services into a single location where Spotify users can more easily track their shared content. Any audio content shared with or by the user will be stored in the Messages inbox that’s accessed under the profile picture in the top-left corner of the app, making it easier to find again in the future. Spotify says the user-to-user messages are 1:1, support text conversations and emoji reactions, and are protected by “industry-standard encryption” — which will hopefully prevent any <a href="https://www.theverge.com/privacy/716386/spotifys-terrible-privacy-settings-just-leaked-palmer-luckeys-bops-and-bangers">embarrassing data leaks</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Users can choose to accept or reject message requests, block other users, or opt out of Messages entirely. Users can also report any shared content and text messages, or the account that sent them, by holding down on the message to flag anything nefarious. Spotify says it will proactively scan Messages for “certain unlawful and harmful content” and review chats that get reported by users.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s unclear if artist accounts will also be able to use the feature to interact with fans. Spotify says that Messages was created to “complement” how content is shared through platforms like Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and TikTok, rather than replace those interactions. It&#8217;s an intriguing social feature for Spotify to add, especially since it’s available to free users, given the hefty limitations on those accounts, and could perhaps pave the way for more direct user-to-user interaction features in the future if it’s received well.</p>
