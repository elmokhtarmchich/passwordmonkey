      <h1>Google tests QR code verification for text messages</h1>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> Aug 25, 2025 | <strong>Author:</strong> Password Monkey</p>
      <p>Google is changing the way you confirm if contacts are legit. The company has begun rolling out a QR code to verify that the person you&#39;re communicating with is, in fact, who they say they are, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/25/google-messages-qr-code-key/"><em>9to5Google</em> reports</a>. The feature is currently available in beta.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An end-to-end encryption card isn&#39;t anything new, but verifying the encryption meant seeing an 80-digit code you could compare. Now, you&#39;ll still go Google Messages, tap their name and then go to their details page. But, instead, there will be an option to show your QR code or scan their code.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Verify keys &quot;ensure only you and your contact can read the RCS messages you send each other,&quot; Google states. The 80-digit comparison is still available if there&#39;s an issue with the QR code.</p>
<p>Google <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html">first announced the new feature</a> last October, stating, &quot;We’re creating a unified system for public key verification across different apps, which you can verify through QR code scanning or number comparison.&quot; At the time, it said the feature would be available on all Android 9 devices and newer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QR codes could be the new norm at Google. The company is also planning to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/gmail-will-stop-using-sms-for-two-factor-authentication-185615193.html">switch SMS-based two-factor authentication</a> on Gmail to QR codes.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/google-tests-qr-code-verification-for-text-messages-114357424.html?src=rss
